## Windows Setup

1. [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_3.16.4-stable.zip) and unzip Flutter SDK to a specific location (eg. `%USERPROFILE%\flutter`).

2. Update the `Path` environment variable with the `flutter\bin` folder location (eg. `%USERPROFILE%\flutter\bin`).

3. Run `flutter doctor` to setup flutter.

4. Disable reporting of Flutter analytics :

```
flutter config --no-analytics
```

5. Set up your IDE (eg. [Android Studio](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)).

6. Re-run the `flutter doctor` command and follow the instructions to complete your testing environment.
